# Prompt

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will
be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between
two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the
words. Do not include any extra spaces.

Example 1:

> Input: s = "the sky is blue"\
> Output: "blue is sky the"

Example 2:

> Input: s = " hello world "\
> Output: "world hello"

Example 3:

> Input: s = "a good example"\
> Output: "example good a"

Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces
  `' '`.
- There is at least one word in `s`.

# Solution

> Time Complexity: `O(n)`\
> Space Complexity: `O(n)`

Another problem that can be solved using JavaScript's built-in methods. We need
to trim the string to remove any leading or trailing spaces, then split the
string into an array of words, reverse the array, and join the words back
together with a single space between each word. Although most of the actions
mutate the array, the split method creates a new array which is why the space
complexity is `O(n)`.
