# Prompt

This is the prompt section. It contains information about the prompt.

It may contain some `code` that is meant to explain the prompt.

Example 1:

> Input: Example Input\
> Output: Example Output

Example 2:

> Input: Example Input\
> Output: Example Output

# Solution

## Approach 1: Title of Approach

> Time Complexity: O(?)\
> Space Complexity: O(?)

This is the solution section. It contains the solution to the prompt. It
explains how I approached the problem.

If there are multiple approaches, I will add a description after the approach
title. If there is only one approach, I will write everything the same except
not include the approach title.

## Approach 2: Title of Approach 2

> Time Complexity: O(?)\
> Space Complexity: O(?)

This is another approach. I should only include this if there are multiple
approaches. I should include information on why this approach may be better or
worse than the previous approach.

# Code

```python
This is the code section. It will contain the code I used for the prompt. I am
still deciding if I should include this by default or if I should hide the code
behind a component and have a click to reveal. For now, it can remain empty.
```

```typescript
If I have solved the problem in another language, I will include the code in the
same codeblock. I would also like to have a way to toggle between the language
and potentially run the code in this box if it's in a supported language like
TypeScript
```

# Visualization

This is the visualization section. If the problem can be better explained with a
visualization, I may include it here. I have not done this yet for any of the
problems I have solved yet, but I may include it in the future.
