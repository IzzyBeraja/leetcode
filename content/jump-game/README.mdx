# Prompt

You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's
first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length
at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

> Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]\
> Output: true

Example 2:

> Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]\
> Output: false

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

# Solution

> Time Complexity: `O(n)`\
> Space Complexity: `O(1)`

In problem 55, the goal is to determine if it is possible to reach the end of an
array of integers by jumping from index to index. We aren't trying to find the
least amount of jumps, just if it is possible with the numbers given to reach
the end.

A way to think about this problem is to imagine you are driving a car and that
each index is a stop with some jerry cans full of fuel. It takes a full jerry
can to move to the next stop. Although you could drive as far as possible with
all the jerry cans you currently have, you could instead drive to the next stop
(which takes one jerry can) and check if it has more fuel that you currently
have. If it does, take the cans at that stop and leave the ones you have on you.
Otherwise, continue to the next stop and repeat until you've reached your
destination. By doing this, you don't have to backtrack if you end up without
fuel at a stop that has no jerry cans. You move from stop to stop to see if
there are better options, allowing you to keep moving forward without looking
back.
