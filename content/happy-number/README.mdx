# Prompt

Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the
  squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops
  endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return `true` if `n` is a happy number, and `false` if not.

Example 1:

> Input: n = 19\
> Output: true

Example 2:

> Input: n = 2\
> Output: false

Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

# Solution

> Time Complexity: `O(n)`\
> Space Complexity: `O(n)`

This problem requires us to find if a number is "happy" by summing the squares
of the digits of the number and repeating until we reach 1 or we loop endlessly.
We can solve this problem by using a hash map to keep track of the numbers we
have seen so far. If we see a number we have already seen, we know we are in a
loop and can return `false`. If we reach 1, we can return `true`.
