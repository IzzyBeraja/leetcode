# Prompt

Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced
to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while
preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same
character, but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:

> Input: s = "egg", t = "add"\
> Output: true

Example 2:

> Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"\
> Output: false

Example 3:

> Input: s = "paper", t = "title"\
> Output: true

Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `t.length == s.length`
- `s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.

# Solution

> Time Complexity: `O(n)`\
> Space Complexity: `O(n)`

This is another hash map problem where we need to keep track of character
mappings. Each character in `s` maps to a character in `t` and vice versa. The
trick here is that we need to map both directions in two separate hash maps to
keep track of the mapping. A character in `s` can only map to one character in
`t` so as long as we know they don't map to a different character, we are set.

Iterate through each character, compare maps, if they differ, return `false`. If
we iterate through the entire string, return `true`.
