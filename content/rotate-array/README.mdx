# Prompt

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k
is non-negative.

Example 1:

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3\
> Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]\

Example 2:

> Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2\
> Output: [3,99,-1,-100]

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 10^5`

# Solution

## Approach 1

> Time Complexity `O(n)`\
> Space Complexity `O(1)`?

I've seen a few different ways to solve this problem. The approach I took
involved removing the last `k` elements of the array and then adding them to the
front. This is simple and easy to understand, yet it benefits greatly from V8's
optimizations. If instead of removing the last `k` elements, you instead popped
one element at a time and then unshifted each, you break the optimization and it
takes significantly longer to compute. I imagine this is because unshift is an
`O(n)` operation that is being called `k` times yet when passing the entire
array, V8 is able to optimize the operation.

## Approach 2

> Time Complexity `O(n)`\
> Space Complexity `O(1)`

Another approach I've seen is to perform three reversals. It's kind of
couterintuitive in my mind, but it works. The idea is that rather than
unshifting and splicing the array, we rotate the elements that are currently at
the back of the array so that they exist at the front. This causes them to be
reversed. From there, since the elements are backwards, we need to reverse each
section, the "front" and the "back".

Let's say that we have an array `[1,2,3,4,5]` and we are shifting it by 3. We
want our array to look like `[3,4,5,1,2]` with elements `[3,4,5]` existing at
the front of the array. We can accomplish this by reversing the entire array.

> Before reversal:\
> [1,2,3,4,5]\
> \
> After reversal:\
> [5,4,3,2,1]

The elements that we want in the front of the array, `[5,4,3]` are now actually
at the front, but they are backwards. We can flip them around by reversing the
first `3` values:

> Before second reversal:\
> [5,4,3,2,1]\
> \
> After second reversal:\
> [3,4,5,2,1]

We are almost there. The last two elements are backwards. We can then reverse
the last 2 elements or the last `nums.length - 3` elements.

> Before third reversal:\
> [3,4,5,2,1]\
> \
> After third reversal:\
> [3,4,5,1,2]

After that third reversal, the array has been properly rotated. Although this
explanation works, I don't know how I'd stumble across this solution naturally.
I wonder if there is a name for this kind of reversal or if it's simply a common
approach.
