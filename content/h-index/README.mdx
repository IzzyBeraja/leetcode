# Prompt

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of
citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return the researcher's
`h-index`.

According to the definition of `h-index` on Wikipedia: The `h-index` is defined
as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at
least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

Example 1:

> Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]\
> Output: 3

Example 2:

> Input: citations = [1,3,1]\
> Output: 1

Constraints:

- `n == citations.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

# Solution

> Time Complexity: `O(nlogn)`\
> Space Complexity: `O(1)`

In this problem, we are tasked with finding the `h-index` of a researcher given
an array of citations. The `h-index` is the largest value `h` such that the
researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least
`h` times. The wording is a little confusing, but with some examples it starts
to make sense.

If a researcher has `5` papers with `[3,0,6,1,5]` citations, the largest `h`
would be `3` since there are `3` papers with at least `3` citations.

I couldn't figure out a way to calculate a rolling `h-index` without the array
being sorted or using more space. If we were okay with using more space, we
could create an array of size `1000` (the max citation value) and store the
frequency of each value. We could then iterate through the array to find the
`h-index`. However, this would take `O(n)` space and time.

I chose to use a slightly slower approach that uses `O(1)` space. We can sort
the array in `O(nlog(n))` time and then iterate through it to find the
`h-index`. For every number we see that is greater than our current `h`, we
increment `h`. Once we have found a number that is less that `h`, we can return
`h`. We could optionally exit early once this happens to save some time.
