# Prompt

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in
nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number
of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get
accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the
  elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not
  important as well as the size of nums
- Return k

Example 1:

> Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3\
> Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]

Example 2:

> Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2\
> Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]

Constraints:

- `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 100`

# Solution

> Time Complexity `O(n)`\
> Space Complexity `O(1)`

In this problem, we are given an array and trying to remove all instances of a
certain value. One way to approach this is the use the remove function that
arrays have, but often that results in elements being shifted which is an `O(n)`
operation. Instead, we can use a two-pointer approach to solve this problem. The
first pointer keeps track of all the valid numbers that we have seen so far. As
we iterate through the array, we check to see if the current number is one of
the allowed numbers. If it is, we swap it with the value at the first pointer
and increment the first pointer. If it is not, we simply move on to the next
number. Once we have iterated through the entire array, the first pointer will
be a count of all the valid numbers and the array will be sorted such that all
of those valid numbers are at the beginning.
