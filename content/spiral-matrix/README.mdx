# Prompt

Given an `m x n` matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Example 1:

> Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]\
> Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

Example 2:

> Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]\
> Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]

Constraints:

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10`
- `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`

# Solution

> Time Complexity: `O(m * n)`\
> Space Complexity: `O(m * n)`

This problem requires that we iterate through a matrix in a spiral fashion. To
accomplish this, we need to keep track of several different values notably:

- The current `row` and `column` we are on
- The `direction` we are currently moving in
- The `boundaries` of the matrix that we have already visited
- The `total` number of elements in the matrix we have visited

We set the boundaries as follows:

- The `right` boundary is the last column
- The `left` boundary is the first column
- The `top` boundary is the second row
- The `bottom` boundary is the last row

Why make the `top` boundary the second row? Since we are currently iterating
through the first row, we don't want to go back to it. By setting the `top`
boundary to the second row, we can avoid this. Once we reach the `right`
boundary, we reduced the `right` boundary by 1 and change the direction to
`down`. For the `right` and `down` boundaries, we reduce the boundary by 1, but
for the `left` and `top` boundaries, we increase the boundary by 1. As we hit
each boundary, we alter the direction to match a clockwise spiral. `right` ->
`down` -> `left` -> `up` -> `right` -> ...

Since we are iterating through the entire matrix, the time complexity is
`O(m * n)` and since we are returning the entire matrix in array form, the space
complexity is `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number
of columns.
