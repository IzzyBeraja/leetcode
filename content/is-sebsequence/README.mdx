# Prompt

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or
false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original
string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the
relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence
of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

Example 1:

> Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"\
> Output: true

Example 2:

> Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"\
> Output: false

Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s1, s2, ..., sk` where
`k >= 10^9`, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence.
In this scenario, how would you change your code?

# Solution

> Time Complexity: `O(n)`\
> Space Complexity: `O(1)`

In this problem, we are trying to find if the letters that make up `s` are in
the same order in `t`. We can do this by iterating through `t` and `s` and
checking if the current letter in `t` is the same as the current letter in `s`.
If it is, we move to the next letter in `s`. We can check if all of the `s`
letters were found if our `s` index is equal to the length of `s`.
